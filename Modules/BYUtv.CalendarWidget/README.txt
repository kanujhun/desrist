This module was created for training purposes.  I created several screencasts that show how to create this module step by step.  I created a Youtube playlist for these screencasts.  View the playlist at http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-GOAU3tpMYm0F1CHYP5_egk0mmAGMab&feature=view_all.

Comments are inline for the individual files with the exception of several helpful links here.
Many of the definitions were copied directly from http://orchardproject.net or from a sub-site of orchardproject.net (ie http://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/).  A special thanks to http://orchardproject.net for all of the hard work and great product!
